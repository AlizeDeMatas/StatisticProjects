For this GUI application I followed the CS50 youtube video for GUI with Python's Tkinter
by Robert Jomar Malate.

For improvements on my App I would like to apply more OOP to my GUI applications once I get
the hang of Python's Tkinter. Also learning how to represent math equations in python

Why a Z-Score Calculator ?
I am currently enrolled into a Statistics math course, I am interested in minoring in Mathematics
and I find that statistics and computer science are like peanut butter and jelly,
they both complement each other.

Why is calculating Z-Scores important ?
Z-scores is a measure of relative - standing of one value relative to all values in
a data set.
It also is a valuable tool for determining whether a particular observation is likely to
occur quite frequently or whether it is unlikely & might be considered an outlier

Zscores less than -2 or more than 2 may be considered as outliers.

It's also used for comparing two unrelated scores to each other to see if a person has better performance,
Like a SAT score compared to an ACT score.

addition features will be adding an outlier calculator and z scores comparison, to see
the better performance.
